# Uncertainty

This library is designed to contain a few algorithms and types that are used to propagate uncertainty.
In general, the ways of propagating uncertainty is through applying these functional rules:
[Propagation of uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty). 

## Intentions of the library
The main design principles of the library is to be
1. Mathematically accurate
2. Clean
3. Intuitive and easy to use

## Types
In the short term, the library will only describe a few distributions (like normal Guassian) but hopefully soon, the system can
be applied to generalized nonlinear distributions using montecarlo methods.
